# AgonArcade handoff

Follow `/home/smith/Agon/mystuff/agon-dev-env/codex/AGENTS.md` for Agon work.
Use repository-root `.venv/bin/python` explicitly for Python tooling.
`TODO.md` is the only authoritative task list for all games in this repository.

Agon Defender is in `defender/`. Read its `AGENTS.md`, README, platform notes and
latest development log before changing it. Build/test with `make -C defender`
and `make -C defender test`. Prepare its isolated profile with
`.venv/bin/python defender/tools/prepare_emulator.py`, then launch with
`./defender/run.sh`, which delegates to the generated profile-local entry point.

Keep new games in sibling subdirectories. This checkout is AgonArcade even
though its existing local directory is named AgonDefender. Pynvaders is separate.
Leave emulator-related changes uncommitted until human validation and explicit
commit approval, as required by the canonical workflow.
